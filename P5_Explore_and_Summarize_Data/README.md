This is the final project of the Exploratory Data Analysis section. The goal of this project was to use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques in a selected dataset to discover relationships among multiple variables, and create explanatory visualizations illuminating distributions, outliers, and anomalies.
Red wine quality dataset(wineQualityReds.csv) was used for this project. Details about the dataset can be found in the "wineQualityInfo.txt" file. The actual exploratory analysis was done with "P5Project_wineReds.Rmd" file. The html file "P5Project_wineReds" includes the full documentation.
